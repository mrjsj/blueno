# Command Line Interface

The former CLI of interacting with Microsoft Fabric has been deprecated. Use the alternative from Microsoft: [fabric-cli](https://microsoft.github.io/fabric-cli/)

The new CLI now works as an interface for managing and  running blueprints.

To get started run the following command:

```bash
blueno -h
```
